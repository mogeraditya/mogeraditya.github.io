Hello! I am Aditya Moger, a 4rd year undergraduate student at IISER Pune, and welcome to my website! I love the life around me and I love studying the abstract, and research in ecology is my way to collate my diverse interests. 

Currently, I am an intern at [Animal Communication and Bioacoustics lab](https://sites.google.com/view/rohinibalakrishnanlab/home) at [CES IISc](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/). I am working under the guidance of Prof. Rohini Balakrishnan and Arpit Omprakash on building a Machine Learning Classifier for fine scale audio data to detect avian vocalizations. 

In my past, I interned at [CES IISc](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/), where I gained valuable insights into sensory ecology, mating behavior and stress physiology at Prof. Maria Thaker's [Macrophysiology Lab](https://mariathaker.weebly.com/). I also worked with Prof. Mohit Kumar Jolly at the [Cancer Systems Biology lab](https://be.iisc.ac.in/~mkjolly/) at IISc, Bangalore on gene regulatory networks. For more details, check out the projects section on this webpage! 

Beyond academia, I find inspiration in the areas of art, music, and photography. Exploring the intersection of science and art is quite fun. I also love teaching and learning the most arbitrary topics. You can find some of my photographs and other blogs in the [blog section](https://mogeraditya.github.io/blog/category/photography/).

Feel free to explore my website and connect with me. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŽ¶âœ¨
