Hello! I am Aditya Moger, a 5rd year undergraduate student at IISER Pune, and welcome to my website! I am primarily interested in studying the weird things groups of animals achieve. Currently I am interested in collective behaviour, which is the hot pot where I combine my interest in simulations and modeling with communication and behavioural ecology.   

When multiple active sensing individuals are in close proximity, the emitted energy pulses can interfere with each other, making it more difficult for an individual to detect objects around it. I am currently working at the [Active Sensing Collectives Group](https://www.activesensingcollectives.com/index.html) with [Dr. Thejasvi Beleyur](https://thejasvibr.github.io/), on modelling collectives of active sensing agents. This is primarily to understand strategies that might be employed by biological systems utilizing active sensing (like bats and whales) to cope with the limited information they have access to in groups.  

I have worked on diverse projects in the past. I interned at [CES IISc](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/) at Prof. Maria Thaker's [Macrophysiology Lab](https://mariathaker.weebly.com/). I also worked with Prof. Mohit Kumar Jolly at the [Cancer Systems Biology lab](https://be.iisc.ac.in/~mkjolly/) at IISc, Bangalore on gene regulatory networks. I also worked in the [Animal Communication and Bioacoustics lab](https://sites.google.com/view/rohinibalakrishnanlab/home) at [CES IISc](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/) with Prof. Rohini Balakrishnan and Arpit Omprakash on building a Machine Learning Classifier for fine scale audio data to detect avian vocalizations. For more details on these projects, check out the projects section on this webpage! 

Beyond academia, I find inspiration in the areas of art, music, and photography. Exploring the intersection of science and art is quite fun. I also love teaching and learning the most arbitrary topics. You can find some of my photography, music and other blogs in the [blog section](https://mogeraditya.github.io/blog/category/photography/). This section is still a work in progress :P
