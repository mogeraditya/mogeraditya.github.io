Hello! I am Aditya Moger and welcome to my website! I'm a passionate 3rd year undergraduate student at IISER Pune, diving into the fascinating world of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 

Currently, I am an intern at [Cancer Systems Biology lab](https://be.iisc.ac.in/~mkjolly/) at IISc, Bangalore. I am studying networks using computer models and boolean simulations to better understand how groups of nodes can be classified into different teams using just the spectral information about the topology of the network. Teams are networks that arise from extending toggle switch like structure onto multiple nodes.

In my past, I interned at [CES IISc](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/), where I'm gaining valuable insights into cutting-edge research at Maria Thaker's [Macrophysiology Lab](https://mariathaker.weebly.com/).

Beyond the realm of academia, I find inspiration in the areas of art, music, and photography. Exploring the intersection of science and art is quite fun. I also love teaching and learning the most arbitrary topics.

Feel free to explore my website and connect with me. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŽ¶âœ¨
