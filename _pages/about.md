Hello! I am Aditya Moger and welcome to my website! I'm a passionate 3rd year undergraduate student at IISER Pune, diving into the fascinating world of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Currently, I'm thrilled to be interning at [CES IISc](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/), where I'm gaining valuable insights into cutting-edge research at Maria Thaker's [Macrophysiology Lab](https://mariathaker.weebly.com/).

Beyond the realm of academia, I find inspiration in the areas of art, music, and photography. Exploring the intersection of science and aesthetics, I believe that the fusion of these elements has the power to ignite profound discoveries and innovations.

Join me on this exhilarating journey as I unravel the mysteries of nature, discovering its hidden evolutionary secrets. Together, let's push the boundaries of knowledge, inspire each other, and unleash our creative spirits. Feel free to explore my website and connect with me. Let's create something extraordinary! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŽ¶âœ¨
