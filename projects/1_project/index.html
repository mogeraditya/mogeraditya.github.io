            <!-- In my past summer, I worked with Dr. Maria Thaker and Subhasmita Patro to study the effects of early-life stress on development, predator avoidance and immune response of lizards. This study was crucial as it gives us insights on how urban lizards cope with stress that comes as a consequence of staying in human dominated areas.<br> 
In this project, I helped with collecting blood samples of lizards to measure their cortisol levels, helped in conducting various behavior assays and learnt how to handle wild animals with care and this made me comfortable with working in the experimental side of biology. I also helped in annotation of the data collected from experiments, designed a protocol on my own for data scoring and also analysed this data. Helping out other people in the lab with field-work, like wild animal capture and handling, has made me proficient in outdoor field-based work.<br>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="brief-motivation">Brief motivation</h2>
<p>Project is about affect of stress in Rock agamas on their development, phys-
iology, behavior and other ecologically relevant features (like sprint speed,
bite force and wound healing).
This study was crucial as it gives us insights on how urban lizards cope with
stress that comes as a consequence of staying in human dominated areas.
Maturity (from juvenile to adult) is an important stage that determines sev-
eral life history traits of an organism. However, it remains largely unstudied
how changes in physiology, behavior and phenotypes are caused by difference
in stress levels during development till sexual maturity.</p>

<h2 id="experimental-setup">Experimental setup</h2>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
<p>Implants are given to wild caught juvenile <em>P. dorsalis</em>. These implants either
release cortisol (hence refered to as CORT treatment) or don’t release any-
thing (hence refered to as SHAM treatment). Note that the juvenile phase is
the peak developmental phase of <em>P. dorsalis</em> and implants are given to both
male and female lizards.
After surgical implantation, these animals are left to grow in an enclosed
space. Collection of data (mentioned in the next section) occurs during the
developmental phase as well as after adulthood is reached.</p>

<h3 id="data-collected">Data collected</h3>
<p>The following data were collected from the <em>P. dorsalis</em> under experimental
treatment.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Morphometric data : X-Ray images were taken after capture using
dental X-Ray tools, every 3 weeks after implantation. The X-Ray is
then landmarked, and the skeletal structure is further analyzed and is
used to compare the difference between CORT and SHAM treatment
as they develop from juveniles to adults. This will be discussed in later
sections.</li>
  <li>Immune Response : A wound is given to a lizard, post numbing, to
see how fast the lizard heals it back. Photographs are taken on a daily
basis for 10 days to capture the healing process of the wound. The
area of the wound is measured using the photographs. The healing
capabilities are then compared between CORT and SHAM treatments.</li>
  <li>Sprint speed : After adulthood is reached, <em>P. dorsalis</em> are brought back
to the lab. These lizards are then allowed to run on a track one by
one, video of which is recorded. The track is marked at regular known
lengths so that the speed of the bouts can be digitally computed. The
lizards run away from humans (which simulates a predator-encounter
like condition) which is used to make them run on the track. This is
done to test predator avoidance capabilities of the lizard, to see if stress
at early stage affects their survival in the wild.</li>
  <li>Bite force : This is collected by making the lizard bite a machine, which
outputs the bite strength in pressure. Biting is a common strategy
employed in male-male aggression interaction and defensive mechanism.</li>
  <li>Behavior data : This is about the number of head bops, push-ups
and other behaviors expressed by the lizards, in the presence of con-
specifics. This is to verify if mating behavior is affected by stress at
juvenile phase.</li>
  <li>Hormonal Response : To check if there are any effects on levels of
testosterone and cortisol, blood tests are run on the test animals. Blood
is collected by inserting a capillary tube behind the eye socket and
tapping into a vein. The blood hormone level is compared with the
baseline blood hormone level.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="work-done">Work Done</h1>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>

<h3 id="sprint-speed-analysis">Sprint Speed Analysis</h3>
<p>I developed the protocol for annotating the lizard sprinting data. Using this
protocol I annotated the data and the analysis of the data is still underway.
(Here’s a link to the protocol developed for scoring of the sprint speed videos.)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dO4wofYg4UtzMAyEoD3jQYwkt1xmnmE/view?usp=drive_link]</p>

<h3 id="landmarking">Landmarking</h3>
<p>X-Ray images were collected of the lizards in captivity post implantation.
The X-Ray images were taken once every 3 weeks to capture growth rates
and development of different body structures of the lizards.
These X-Ray images need to be landmarked (annotation of data) so that
further morphometric analysis can be carried out on them. Landmarking
was done using tpsDig software of over 180 images and repeated thrice in
order to minimize human error.</p>

<h3 id="immune-response">Immune Response</h3>
<p>Photographing of wounds were done for 10 days after the day of wound-
ing. Imaging was done using phone camera (Galaxy M12) directly from the
lizard tanks. To ensure that the lizards do not move during the photograph-
ing process, images were taken early in the morning (before sun rise) while
the lizards were still asleep. <em>P. dorsalis</em> are diurnal animals, that are physi-
ologically constrained to be active when the sun is out.
The photographs of the wounds will be used the measure the wound size and
thus used to compute rate of healing based on how much the area has reduced 
over the span of 10 days. The rates are then compared between SHAM and
CORT treatment, to see if continued exposure to stress from juvenile phase
effects the wound healing capabilities of adult lizards.</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>

<h3 id="field-work">Field work</h3>
<p>Field work involved capturing lizards and measuring different morphometrics.
Majority of the field work was carried out in the rocky terrain of Kolar, India.
These lizards were caught and bagged, using modified fishing rods as nooses.</p>

<h3 id="data-collection-in-lab">Data collection in lab</h3>
<p>Lizard X-Ray data and blood samples were collected in the lab. The videos
for sprint speed analysis were also recorded in a lab setting.
Also, I was involved in care-taking of lizards in the lab enclosure, which
involved feeding them and cleaning.</p>

<h1 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>I would like to thank Subhasmita Patro for the guidance and support.
I would also like to thank Prof. Maria Thaker and the Macrophysiology lab
for being very inclusive and for making my summer experience memorable.</p>
