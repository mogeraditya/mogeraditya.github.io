    Advised by PhD student Mohammed Amir Sadiq from Prof. Rohini Balakrishnan's lab.

In this project, I studied different ways animals communicate and the variety of communication methods they use. I learned in detail about the physical and mechanical limitations of sound production and how animals optimize their sounds for communication.<br> 
Additionally, I explored the effects of human-generated noise on animal communication and discovered potential solutions to mitigate these effects. <br>
Currently, I am working on a review article titled "Plasticity vs Vulnerability: Through the Lens of Anthropogenic Noise." I aim to compile information from various studies on the impact of human-generated noise on animals and determine if plasticity significantly affects an organism's vulnerability.<br>
