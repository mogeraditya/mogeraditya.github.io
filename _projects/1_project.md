Studied various different ways in which animals communicate, and diversity of modes of communication employed.
Learnt about physiological and mechanical constraints for sound production and how animals optimize the sound produced for acoustic signalling.
Learnt about Athropogenic noise, about how it effects animal communication and potential solutions that can be employed to prevent the same.
Currently writing a Review Article about Plasticity vs Vunerability : Through the lens of anthropogenic noise.
