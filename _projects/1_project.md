Advised by PhD student Mohammed Amir Sadiq from Prof. Rohini Balakrishnan's lab. <br>
In this project, I studied various different ways in which animals communicate, and about how diverse modes of communications are employed by animals. <br>
I learnt in great detail about physiological and mechanical constraints for sound production and how animals optimize the sound produced for acoustic signalling. <br>
I also learnt about Anthropogenic noise, about how it effects animal communication and potential solutions that can be employed to prevent the same.<br>
Currently writing a Review Article about Plasticity vs Vunerability : Through the lens of anthropogenic noise. I am also trying to find a way to compile information from various studies done on effects of anthropogenic noise on animals and see if there is a signification impact of plasticity on vulnerability of an organism.<br>
